Ignore most stuff from app, you can go through it if you want but it's just calling components, and global css is colors and layout is also the header UI.
ALSO only OVERVIEW, CALL INSIGHTS, COSTS, TRANSCRIPTS, RECORDINGS & SETTINGS are the main TABS, I don't know why Chat insights, costs usage, live feed, agent scores, etc exist. I dont know if you can delete it either....
Components is the main area with all the full TSX files.
In COMPONENTS only care about OVERVIEW, CALL INSIGHTS, COSTS, TRANSCRIPTS, RECORDINGS & SETTINGS, obviously...
the UI folder is normal react UI maybe you gotta touch for something?..i dont think so tho..
THEME PROVIDER in components is for the dark and light mode
!! Every component has alot of garbage hardcode !! get rid obviously and call the api shit
